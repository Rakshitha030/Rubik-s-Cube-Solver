# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver
This project is a Rubik’s Cube solver that takes the current scrambled state of a Rubik’s Cube and computes the sequence of moves required to solve it. The solver uses advanced algorithms (like the ZZ method or CFOP) to efficiently find the solution. It includes features such as:

Accurate color detection from manual input

Implementation of real cube move mechanics

Step-by-step solving stages: Edge Orientation, EOLine, F2L, OLL, and PLL

Integration with webcam input for real-time cube scanning

3D visualization of the cube and its solution moves

The solver is designed for both educational and practical use, helping users understand the solving process or automatically solve their physical cube.
